# Money Moves: Financial Web App #
Money Moves is a web application that aims to simplify the process of assessing stock performance. The project combines finance and technology to produce a unique solution that provides an easy-to-understand style of presenting financial data.

## Motivation ##
The stock market is a complex and ever-changing landscape, making it difficult for individuals to keep track of the performance of certain equities. Furthermore, finance and technology are continually growing fields, and this project aims to discover methods to combine the two to produce novel solutions. Money Moves is not only a useful tool for stock market enthusiasts, but it also demonstrates the power of combining finance and technology.

## Significance ##
With so much data available on the internet, it is becoming increasingly vital to quickly obtain and evaluate this data to make informed decisions. Web scraping and data visualization are effective methods for extracting important information from the Internet and presenting it in an understandable manner. In this project, web scraping and data visualization will be used to collect and show information on a certain topic, such as stock prices, to provide a better understanding and enable users to make more informed decisions.

## Goals & Objectives ##
The primary objective of this project is to create a web application that allows users to access financial data for certain stocks and other financial information in a user-friendly style. The following objectives will be accomplished to reach this goal:

* Gather financial data from websites such as Yahoo Finance and Google Finance using web scraping techniques
* Store the collected data in a database such as MongoDB
* Create a web application that allows users to search for and see stock performance data using a web framework such as Flask or Django
* Use data visualization tools to present the data in an interactive and understandable fashion
* Integrate machine learning algorithms to evaluate data and make forecasts or offer insights on stock performance (basic statistical analysis)

## Methodology ##
The methodology for this project involves exploring several web scraping approaches and libraries such as Beautiful Soup or Scrapy to collect data from various websites. Interactive visualizations of data will be built using data visualization packages such as D3.js or Plotly.d. The visualizations will be displayed by creating a website or desktop application using a web development framework such as Flask or Django. The web scraping tool and visualizations will be tested to ensure they are functioning correctly and effectively. The tool's performance will be continuously monitored, and improvements will be made as necessary.

## Extensions ##
Several features can be added to the web application to provide more value to users. For instance, users can establish and maintain their own portfolios, allowing them to enter the stocks they hold, the number of shares they possess, and the amount they paid for each stock. The web app can then show the user's portfolio's current worth as well as the % change in value since the user purchased the stock. Visualizations such as candlestick charts, line charts, etc., can also be included to give users a better sense of how their portfolio has performed over time.

Other features that can be included in the web application are financial calculators such as a retirement savings calculator, a mortgage calculator, or a loan calculator to assist consumers in making financial decisions. Additionally, a function can be added that allows users to compare different equities and market indexes against one another, allowing them to observe how different investments perform in comparison to one another. Visualization tools like heatmaps or radar charts can also be included to help consumers understand the success of various investments quickly and simply.

This project will be an excellent opportunity to utilize my skills in web development, web scraping, and data visualization, and it will also be a valuable addition to my portfolio.
