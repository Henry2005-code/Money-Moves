        <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
        <p>Individuals may find it challenging to maintain track of the performance of certain equities in the stock market since it is a complicated and ever-changing landscape. Furthermore, the fields of finance and technology are continually growing, and discovering methods to combine the two to produce novel solutions is an intriguing potential. This project's purpose is to develop a web application that streamlines the process of assessing stock performance by extracting financial data from numerous sources and showing it in an easy-to-understand style. This project will not only provide a useful tool for stock market enthusiasts, but it will also illustrate the power of combining finance and technology to produce new and unique solutions.</p>
